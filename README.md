HOMEWORK 6B README FILE

For homework 6b, my website is able to cancel appointments from the Appointment page.



WEBSITE INSTRUCTIONS
From the home page, index.html, you can schedule a new appointment. You may also navigate to the Appointments page to schedule an appointment.

After scheduling a new appointment, you will see a confirmation page with the appointment details.

On the appointments page, you will see upcoming appointments in more detail and have to ability to cancel them.

In the future, I will link the "Upcoming Appointments" table on the home page to the savedd appointments in memory, so those dates and details will update accordingly.
