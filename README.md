HOMEWORK 6A README FILE

For homework 6a, my website is able to schedule & save appointments.
You can schedule appointments either from the home page or the appointments tab.

After scheduling a new appointment, you will see a confirmation page with the appointment details.

To use the project, begin with the index.html file to enter the home page. Then, use the button on the homepage to schedule an appointment or navigate to the Appointments page to view any existing appointments or schedule a new appointment.


In the future, you will be able to manage your appointments from the appointments tab. Please note that I have not built out that functionality yet. I also have not built out the lab results or forms pages yet. I have not yet linked the "Upcoming Appointments" table on the home page to the upcoming appointments, but in the future, those dates and details will update accordingly.
