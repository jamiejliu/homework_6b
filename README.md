HOMEWORK 6B README FILE

NEW FUNCTIONALITY:
For homework 6b, my website is able to cancel appointments from the Appointment page.


WEBSITE INSTRUCTIONS
From the home page, index.html, you can schedule a new appointment. You may also navigate to the Appointments page to schedule an appointment.
After scheduling a new appointment, you will see a confirmation page with the appointment details.
On the appointments page, you can see upcoming appointments in more detail and have to ability to cancel them.


BONUS: RESPONSIVE DESIGN
For the bonus, I ensured that my website was responsive to different laptop and tablet sizes. The text, margins, buttons, and table should resize accordingly depending on screensize as I used percentages, vh, and vw. There were a few elements where I chose to keep pixels, for example the border radius of 1px and box shadows because I felt that changing the size of the display did not have a significant impact on their appearance.

My website is not responsive to mobile devices yet.


NEXT STEPS:
My website is still not fully complete. I still need to code the Lab Results and Forms page.
I also have not connected the "Upcoming Appointments" table on the home page with the saved appointments in memory. In the future, these dates and details should match the information on the Information page.
